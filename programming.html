            <p>MIMI THI NGUYEN is Associate Professor of Gender and Women's Studies and Asian American Studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She is also Interim Chair of Gender and Women's Studies for 2017-2018. Her first book, called <i>The Gift of Freedom: War, Debt, and Other Refugee Passages</i>, focuses on the promise of “giving” freedom concurrent and contingent with waging war (Duke University Press, 2012; Outstanding Book Award in Cultural Studies from the Association of Asian American Studies, 2014). She is also co-editor with Fiona I.B. Ngo and Mariam Lam of a special issue of <i>Positions: Asia Critique</i> on Southeast Asian American Studies (20:3, Winter 2012), and co-editor with Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu of <i>Alien Encounters: Pop Culture in Asian America</i> (Duke University Press, 2007). Her papers have been solicited for the Feminist Theory Archive at Brown University. Her following project is called The Promise of Beauty.</p>

            <p>Nguyen was first introduced to the D.I.Y. punk scene in San Diego, CA, a lasting influence that can easily be seen in her wide range of publications. She has made zines since 1991, including <i>Slander</i> (formerly known by other titles) and the compilation zine <i>Race Riot.</i> She is a former <i>Punk Planet</i> columnist and <i>Maximumrocknroll</i> volunteer. Her columns are archived at thread &amp; circuits. She is also co-author of the (mostly retired) research blog on dress and beauty, <i>Threadbared</i>. In June 2013, Sarah McCarry's Guillotine ("a series of erratically published chapbooks focused on revolutionary non-fiction") released <i>PUNK</i>, a conversation between Nguyen and Golnar Nikpour. She toured with other zine makers of color in 2012 and 2013, and continues to organize events and shows with and for POC punks.</p>

            <h5>Led by Visiting Scholar at the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University</h5>
            <h4> Opening Ceremony &middot; Friday, March 2nd </h4>
            <p>DIANE WONG is a doctoral candidate in Government at Cornell University, where she writes on race, gender, and the gentrification of Chinatowns. As a writer, educator, and multimedia storyteller, her research stems from a place of revolutionary praxis and deep love for community. As a first generation Chinese American woman born and raised in Flushing, Queens, her research is intimately tied to the Chinese diaspora and urban immigrant experience. Her current research explores how gentrification led displacement politically impacts the Chinese immigrant communities in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Mellon Foundation, American Political Science Association, and Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center, and it has appeared in a variety of publications, journals, anthologies, and podcasts. Diane is currently a visiting scholar at the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University where she is writing her dissertation and collaborating with community groups like CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, Chinatown Art Brigade, and the W.O.W. Project. Previously, Diane worked as the Social Media Organizer for 18 Million Rising and the Director of Advocacy for the East Coast Asian American Student Union on campaigns related to racial justice, civic engagement, media representation, ethnic studies, detention and deportation, and Islamophobia.</p>

            <h5>Led by Owner of Wing on Wo &amp; Co. (W.O.W) </h5>
            <h4> Opening Ceremony &middot; Friday, March 2nd </h4>
            <p> MEI LUM is the fifth-generation owner of her family’s 92-year-old porcelain ware business and the oldest operating store in New York City's Chinatown, Wing on Wo &amp; Co. (W.O.W). In early 2016, her family’s building and business was on the brink of sale. In an effort to resist against contributing to the process of gentrification in Chinatown, Mei decided to take on the role of running W.O.W to continue her family’s five-generation-long legacy in the neighborhood and help protect the heart of Chinatown from encroaching gentrifying forces. Since May 2016, Mei has been working to bring community members' concerns of a rapidly changing Chinatown into a space for dialogue through her work with The W.O.W Project, a community initiative reclaiming ownership over Chinatown's future by reviving, protecting and encouraging Chinatown's creative culture through arts, culture and activism. This past year, Mei was recognized as an emerging voice in the APA community from NBC Asian America and was one of the honorees at the Museum of Chinese in America's Annual Community Heroes Celebration. Currently, Mei is a National Art Strategies' Creative Community Fellow where she is working to build a socially-minded business model for W.O.W that supports the future growth of The W.O.W Project.</p>

            <h4> Closing Ceremony &middot; Saturday, March 3rd </h4>
            <p>BAMBU is a father, MC, and community organizer. Raised in the Watts district of Los Angeles, as a young boy he experienced a life that other rappers have glorified, but rarely experienced. As he navigated through a turbulent youth, Bambu turned around the destructive energy that surrounded him and poured it into making music. <p>
            <p>Bambu has been lauded by his fans and contemporaries for his lyrical storytelling abilities. Whether fictional or autobiographical, his vividly-detailed narratives are characterized by an honesty that is equal parts brutal, thought-provoking and liberating. Bambu’s music is not for mere performance – he utilizes his music as a tool for a larger goal – to reach and support youth who face similar issues that he did, and move them to question what goes on in the world around them. Bambu has reached audiences across the country and internationally with his explosive and engaging live performances. Being paired on concert billings with such acts as Immortal Technique, Blue Scholars, Zion I, Psycho Realm, dead prez, Evidence, Atmosphere and Brother Ali, to name a few, has afforded Bambu the opportunity to garner fans from varying demographics. With a catalog of music stretching the span of ten-years, the Los Angeles emcee has allowed his fans to witness the growth of a gracefully honest artist, who truly embodies the sentiment of the people.</p>

                <h4 style='font-size:22px;'> These are spaces that will be informal, casual spaces for folks to network, connect, and build community. There will be one time slot of 60 minutes for caucuses, with one announcement in the middle to remind folks that they are allowed to drift from space to space. Caucus facilitators will have final say as to whether allies/advocates are welcome in that space.<h4>

And it’s true. In a country where state violence, homelessness, and suicide disproportionately impact communities that are queer, trans, and people of color, fear digs graves for the living and often elude our efforts to triumph, seek happiness, and fulfill our dreams. In this workshop, participants will read Vuong and Reeves. We will talk about what radical love might look like for us and the people we fight for.

The 1990s saw an explosion of zine publishing, with everything from poetry and personal writing, to food and record reviews, to zines about work, cats, health, feminism, race and racism, and everything in between. What all zines have in common is that their writers and editors (often the same people/person) feel like they have something important to say that they would like to share with others.

Together, we’ll take a look at the relationship between Asian Americans, Black Americans, and White Americans and explore the concepts of racial hierarchy and power dynamics between racial groups.

Transracial adoption films will be used as examples to show how general definitions of Asian American identity are centered around the “Asian American experience” of not only having Asian racial heritage, but also being raised in and identifying with the Asian American culture. When looking at films/documentaries relating to transracial Asian adoption, there is a dominating trope - one that I label the “kinship-roots narrative” - that allows adoptee visibility, but only if it obeys the strict portrayal of an adoptee. The goal of this workshop is to be the alternative representation of adoptees that it calls for.', 'Susanna Birnbaum.png"',
